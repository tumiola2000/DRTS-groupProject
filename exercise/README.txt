The files in the Exerercise/Content tab are test cases are provided as a starting point for the 02225 DRTS exercise.

They are in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format and contain the model parameters for periodic tasks:
  
  - Task: Task name
  - BCET: Best-case execution time
  - WCET: Worst-case execution time
  - Period: Task period
  - Deadline: Task deadline (equal to the period)
  - Priority: Task priority (assigned by Rate Monotonic scheduling, with lower period yielding higher priority)

These examples illustrate one possible format. Students may use a different format and create additional test cases.
